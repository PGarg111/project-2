                   Located at the intersection of Johnston Road and Ballantyne Commons Parkway, Ballantyne Village serves as the central hug for the Ballantyne neighborhood. Looking at its architecture, it blends Art Deco elegance with "Main Street" charm, anchored by a striking glass "Crown" tower housing a multi-level movie theater with dynamic LED lighting. The village features:

                    <li>Boutique retail shops</li>
                    <li>Personal care services</li>
                    <li>Restaurants</li>
                    <li>Office space + additional office development replacing the former cinema</li>
                    <li>Plaza and outdoor gathering space, often housing pop-up markets and events</li>
                   </ul>
                   The Blackfinn Ameripub is known for its popular outdoor seating. Ballantyne Village also offers a curated mix of upscale and refined dining, shopping, and service experiences tailored to the surrounding affluent community. 
                   The village benefits from the easy access to nearby residential, office, and hotel developments. It's close to the Panorama Tower's mixed-use amenities, surface lots, and a covered parking deck, making it a pedestrian and family friendly gathering spot.

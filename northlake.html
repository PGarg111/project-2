                    Northlake Mall is a two-story enclosed shopping center located about 8 miles north of Uptown Charlotte. It opened in 2005 and was envisioned to fill a longtime retail gap in North Mecklenburh County. It has about 120-150 stores and restaurants and anchors which include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Belk</li>
                        <li>Dillard's</li>
                        <li>Macy's</li>
                        <li>14-screen AMC Theatre</li>
                        <li>H&M (a junior anchor)</li>
                    </ul>
                    The mall offers a family-friendly environment with features like a Looney Tunes play area, a Coffee Coury, free Wi-Fi, valet parking, stroller rentals, and wheelchair access. There are many places shoppers can enjoy quick bites and sit-down dining options. Northlake has had quite a few challenges: it entered receivership in 2021 due to debt issues, vacancy is around 85% (which is an improvement to the 30% before) in 2023, and there have been mutiple security incidents.
